# My Python Learning Journey 🐍

Hey there! This is my very first GitHub repository, so please bear with me. I'm learning Python from the ground up, and this is where I'll be dumping all my practice code, messy notes, and eventually, some cool projects.

My guide on this adventure is the awesome **free Python course from CodeWithHarry** on YouTube. I'm basically using this repo as my public notebook to track my progress and keep myself accountable.

Wish me luck! 🚀

## The Plan: What I'm Learning

Here's the roadmap I'm following. I'll be creating a folder for each chapter as I complete it.

*   **Chapter 0: The Big Start**
    *   Okay, so what even *is* programming?
    *   Getting Python and VS Code set up on my machine.

*   **Chapter 1: Getting My Hands Dirty**
    *   Wrote my first `Hello, World!` program!
    *   Figured out what `pip` is and installed my first module (`pyjokes` was fun!).
    *   Learned how to leave comments so I can remember what my code does later.
    *   **[My Code](./Chapter-01-Practice-Set/)**

*   **Chapter 2: Variables & Data Types**
    *   Learning how to store information (variables).
    *   The basic data types: strings, numbers (integers/floats), and booleans.
    *   Making the computer do math with operators.

*   **Chapter 3: All About Strings**
    *   Diving deeper into how strings work.
    *   Slicing and dicing them to get the parts I want.
    *   Some useful string methods.

*   **Chapter 4: Lists and Tuples**
    *   Lists: A way to store a bunch of items together. They're changeable (mutable).
    *   Tuples: Like lists, but you can't change them (immutable).

*   **Chapter 5: Dictionaries & Sets**
    *   Dictionaries: Storing things in `key: value` pairs. Seems super useful.
    *   Sets: Like lists, but they only store unique items.

*   **Chapter 6: Making Decisions**
    *   Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make my programs smarter.

*   **Chapter 7: Doing Things Over and Over (Loops)**
    *   `while` and `for` loops to avoid writing the same code again and again.

*   **Chapter 8: Functions & Recursion**
    *   Creating my own reusable blocks of code (functions).
    *   Recursion... a function that calls itself? This sounds like it could break my brain, but I'm ready.

*   **Chapter 9: Working with Files**
    *   Reading data from files and writing data to them.

*   **Chapter 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    *   This seems like a big one. Learning about `classes` and `objects`.

*   **Chapter 11: More OOP (Inheritance)**
    *   Making new classes based on existing ones.

*   **Chapter 12 & 13: Advanced Stuff**
    *   Exploring more modern Python features, like `try/except` for handling errors, lambda functions, and virtual environments.

## The Fun Stuff: Projects! 🛠️

This is what I'm most excited about. Applying what I've learned to build actual things.

1.  **Project 1: Snake, Water, Gun Game**
    *   My first ever game in Python! This was all about using `if-else` statements to make the game logic work.

2.  **Project 2: The Perfect Guess**
    *   Building a number guessing game where the computer gives you hints. This was great for practicing loops.

3.  **Mega Project 1: Jarvis AI Assistant**
    *   The first MEGA project! Trying to build a simple version of an AI assistant. This involved using speech recognition and connecting to the OpenAI API, which was a huge step up.

4.  **Mega Project 2: Auto-Reply WhatsApp Bot**
    *   Another big one. The goal here was to make a bot that could read my WhatsApp messages and send replies automatically. This involved screen automation, which is super cool.
