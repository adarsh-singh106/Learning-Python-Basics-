# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey — Completed!

Hi! I'm someone who just finished learning Python by following the free YouTube course by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry).

This is my **first-ever GitHub repository**, where I’ve uploaded everything I learned — from my first `print("Hello, World!")` to building basic projects using what I’ve learned.

It's not perfect, but it's real. Just a collection of practice files, project folders, and a bunch of things that helped me understand Python better.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- All **chapter-wise code**
- **Practice problems** after each topic
- Some simple **projects**
- Few extra files and folders I created while experimenting and debugging

## ✅ Chapters I’ve Covered

| Chapter | Topics Covered                         |

## 🧪 Projects I Built

## 📌 What's Next?

Now that I’ve got the basics of Python, I’m planning to start learning **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) with Python**.

## 🙌 Thanks!

Big thanks to **CodeWithHarry** for the amazing Python course.  
This repo may look basic, but it means a lot to me because it shows how far I’ve come.

> If you're just starting out like me, don't worry — just keep going.
